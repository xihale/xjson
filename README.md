## Introduction

The core functions are available.

It has many problems now, so it's not recommended to use it in the production environment.

## Todo

- [ ] use `interpreter` mode to speed up the parsing(now it's slow as O(kn) where 1<=k<=(depth of recursion))

## Usage

It's recommended to have a look at the `tests/json.cpp` file, all the simple example are over there.

## Docs

The apis iterate rapidly, so it is just blank now.
